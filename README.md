## 🧑‍💻 About Me  
I am a passionate learner in **VLSI Design**, currently pursuing my **M.Tech in VLSI Design** at  
**SRM Institute of Science and Technology, Kattankulathur**.  

I hold a **Bachelor's degree in Electrical and Electronics Engineering (EEE)** and my interest lies in building and simulating **digital systems using Verilog HDL**.  

This GitHub serves as my **portfolio to showcase projects, coding practice, and learning journey** in Digital Design.
